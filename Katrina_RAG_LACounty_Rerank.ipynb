Laundry repair and reuse services can help maintain and extend the life of garments and bedding. Reusable tablecloths, napkins and table skirts can be used instead of single-use options and rags can be used to wash and dry vehicles. Linens are reused in hospitals, rehabilitation centres and fire stations. Donating used textiles to thrift stores or using a textile recycling service can prevent textiles from ending up in landfills.\"},{\"Filename\":\"RMIS_Landscaping_17_final.pdf\",\"Summaries\":\"As of 2016, AB 1826 required businesses generating a certain amount of organic waste per week to arrange for recycling services, and Los Angeles County has implemented programs to divert organic waste from landfills. Organic waste, including green waste, makes up a significant percentage of California's waste stream and can be repurposed through mulching, chipping, grinding, composting, or recycling. Landscape management contracts can require landscapers to take green waste to facilities for reuse, and leaving grass clippings on the lawn after mowing, known as grasscycling, can provide nutrients for fertilization while reducing green waste. Utilizing drought-tolerant plants native to California can reduce green waste, conserve water, reduce pesticide use, and lower maintenance costs.\"},{\"Filename\":\"RMIS_FoodServiceWasteDiversion_11_final.pdf\",\"Summaries\":\"Organic waste, including food waste, comprises a significant portion of the waste stream and emits harmful greenhouse gases when disposed of in landfills. Organic recycling programs can help mitigate these emissions by turning food waste into feedstock for livestock, fuel for vehicles, and nutrient-rich soil. Food service operations can establish recycling and organic waste collection programs to reduce waste disposal and comply with regulations such as California's Senate Bill 1383, which requires businesses to arrange for organic waste recycling. This article provides guidance on setting up organic recycling programs, tips for waste reduction, and case studies from Los Angeles County facilities.\"},{\"Filename\":\"RMIS_FoodServiceWaste_18_final.pdf\",\"Summaries\":\"Food waste is a significant problem in the United States, with over a third of all food produced being lost or wasted each year. Food waste has a negative impact on both the environment and society, as it increases pollution and exacerbates hunger. This article provides strategies that food service facilities can use to reduce their food waste, including the use of reusable trays and crates, implementing food supply rotation practices, and repurposing leftover food and scraps. These strategies can help facilities save money, feed hungry people in their community, and protect the environment by reducing the resources used to produce food that is ultimately wasted.\"},{\"Filename\":\"Organicsfactsheet_2022.pdf\",\"Summaries\":\"In order to reduce climate change and generate renewable products, Los Angeles county proposes implementing a mandatory organic waste recycling for all county departments. Organic waste, which is comprised of food waste and food-soiled paper products, accounts for nearly 15% of all disposal in the county. Therefore, recycling such waste would be extremely beneficial to the county. This proposal will require all county departments to arrange for organic waste recycling, including donating excess edible food to local food recovery organizations.\"},{\"Filename\":\"https:\\/\\/www.greenpolicy360.net\\/w\\/Los_Angeles,_CA_Zero_Waste_Plan\",\"Summaries\":\"For the first time, Los Angeles is developing the Solid Waste Integrated Resources Plan, also known as SWIRP, seeks input from a broad section of the community, and will result in the development of a 20-year master plan for the City\\u2019s solid waste and recycling programs.

Many areas, including California, have implemented laws requiring businesses to arrange for organic waste recycling. Non-compliance may result in fines or other penalties. \\n\\n2. **Source Separation**: Implement a system for separating organic waste from other waste streams at the source. This can include placing different colored bins for different types of waste in key areas around your business premises to make it easy for your staff to differentiate between organic waste, recyclables, and other waste items. Having different colored or labeled bins helps with streamlining the sorting process once the waste is collected. \\n\\n3. **Utilization of Recycling Programs**: Take advantage of available recycling programs for organic waste, such as composting or mulching programs. These programs can help to reduce the amount of organic waste that is sent to landfills and can repurpose organic waste into useful products.\\n\\n4. **Donation of Edible Food**: Donate excess edible food to local food recovery organizations to support the community and reduce organic waste. This is a form of organic waste removal that complies with organic waste recycling while aiding the community. \\n\\n5. **Education and Training**: Provide education and training to your staff on proper organic waste removal and recycling practices. This can include information on how to identify organic waste, how to properly separate it from other waste streams, and how to participate in organic recycling programs such as composting. \\n\\n6. **Waste Reduction**: Implement strategies to reduce organic waste generation in the first place, such as using reusable trays and crates, implementing food supply rotation practices, and repurposing leftover food and scraps. \\n\\n7. **Utilization of Grasscycling**: Grasscycling involves leaving grass clippings on the lawn after mowing, which provides nutrients for fertilization while reducing green waste. \\n\\n8. **Use of Drought-Tolerant Plants**: Utilize drought-tolerant plants native to your area to reduce the amount of green waste generated and conserve water. \\n\\n9. **Textile Waste Reduction**: Implement strategies to reduce textile waste, such as using laundry repair and reuse services, donating used textiles to thrift stores or using a textile recycling service, and using reusable tablecloths, napkins, and table skirts instead of single-use options. \\n\\n10. **Organic Recycling Programs**: Food service operations can establish recycling and organic waste collection programs to reduce waste disposal and comply with regulations. These programs can turn food waste into feedstock for livestock, fuel for vehicles, and nutrient-rich soil. \\n\\nRemember, proper organic waste removal and recycling practices can help to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to a more sustainable future. \\n\\nWould you like me to go into more detail about any of the practices listed above? \"\n",
