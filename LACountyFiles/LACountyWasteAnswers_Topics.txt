Effective  \nApril 1, 2016, the State\u2019s Mandatory \nCommercial Organic Waste Recycling law \n(Assembly Bill 1826) began phasing \nin requirements for businesses \nthat generate organic waste, \nto arrange for that material \nto be donated, recycled or \ncomposted. \nBusinesses generating \ntwo cubic yards or \nmore of waste per week, \nmust arrange for organic \nwaste recycling services. \nLos Angeles County Internal \nServices Department added organic \nwaste recycling services to the Facility \nAncillary Services Master Agreement hauler \ncontracts.\nLos Angeles County unincorporated areas \nsuccessfully diverted 37% of organic waste \nand converted it into mulch, compost and \nbiofuel. The State goal is to reach a 75% \nreduction of 2014 organic waste disposal \nlevels by 2025. To reduce green waste, County facilities \nare encouraged to replace grass turf with \ndrought-tolerant plants and to grasscycle \nmowed lawns.\nNative and drought-tolerant plants grow \nslowly \u2014 reducing the need for fertilizer, \nwaste collection, and maintenance \ncosts. Using grass clippings and wood \nchips onsite not only reduces waste but \nimproves water retention and provides a \nnatural fertilizer.Organic waste makes up 28.2%  \nof the California Waste Stream. \nOf the 11.1 million tons of organic waste:\n5.9 million tons is food waste\n2.1 million tons is green \nwaste\nFigures from the CalRecycle 2018 Facility-Based \nCharacterization of Solid Waste in California  \n(May 15, 2020)-AB1826.\nGREEN WASTE AND WOOD WASTE OTHER ORGANIC WASTE TO BE RECYCLEDLos Angeles County Facility Case Studies\nLearn How to Grasscycle \nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates that \na 5,000 square foot lawn can trap over 85 pounds of dust, dirt, pollen \nand mold to help cool surroundings. Grass provides valuable benefits \nwhen properly maintained, mowed and watered.  \nLos Verdes Golf Course in Palos Verdes has 70 acres of turf. \nApproximately 455 tons of clippings per year are left on the turf. \nThis practice, known as grasscycling, reduces 125 metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide annually \u2014 the equivalent of saving 14,000 gallons \nof gasoline. Grasscycling also fertilizes the lawn, retains moisture \nand reduces water usage. Start grasscycling by instructing your \nlandscapers to leave grass \nclippings on the grass after \nmowing or use a mulching \nmower that directly applies \ngrass clippings back into  \nthe soil. \nLearn more at: \nSmartGardening.com/gr.cfm\nUpdate Landscaping Contracts \nUtilizing contracted landscape service to manage green waste \nand yard trimmings is an effective way to manage this material. \nTo ensure services are properly performed it may be necessary to \nupdate landscape contracts. \n At Los Angeles County Library Headquarters, Sepco Earthscape Inc. \ntakes cut branches, shrubbery and grass clippings to a green waste \nfacility for mulching and recycling. The site can ensure items are taken \nto the correct facility which reduces overall solid waste disposal and \nprevents valuable materials from being landfilled. If contracted organic \nwaste recycling services are feasible for your facility it is important \nto review the contract and \nmake sure it includes clauses \nand provisions requiring the \ncontractor to take any green \nwaste to an approved mulching \nor green waste composting \nfacility.  Additional clauses \nshould note that landscape \ncrews are prohibited from \ndisposing of any green waste \nand yard trimmings in on-site \nsolid waste bins. Chip and Mulch Tree Trimmings \nCounty Fire Station 81 \nmaintains five acres of land \nwith a variety of plants \nincluding shrubs, trees and \ngrasses. The station generates \nwood chips and mulch from \ntrimmed trees and uses it \non-site and at other stations. \nLarger pieces of trees are \nchopped and stored for wood. \nSmaller pieces are chipped into \nmulch and placed on the soil to encourage moisture retention and \nreduce weeds. Wood chips and mulch provide a uniform, aesthetically \npleasing appearance to pathways, walkways, hillsides and other \nlandscaped areas. \nEncourage the use of mulch by requiring your maintenance staff \nto save pruned woody materials. Coordinate with your facility \nmaintenance or landscaping department to bring a chipper when the \nmaterial pile reaches a sufficient size. Once chipped, spread mulch \non larger trees and shrubs to maintain moisture near root areas. \nMaintain additional mulch for subsequent use in a cooler area away \nfrom flammable liquids and solvents.\nInstall Drought-T olerant Landscaping \nCareful planting and efficient \nirrigation systems can reduce \nirrigation water use by 70%. \nThis practice reduces overall \nwater usage and associated \nwater consumption costs. \nDrought-tolerant plants grow \nslowly, require less pruning  \nand produce less landscape \nwaste. All of these benefits \ncan reduce costs for labor, \nmaterials and disposal.  \nCentral Juvenile Hall installed drought-tolerant landscaping in \nmultiple areas of the facility. These areas are a waste and water \nreduction benefit, and they also beautify the grounds. Gravel and \nmulch also can protect the soil; thereby, reducing the need for soil \namendments and fertilizer. Learn more at: SmartGardening.com\n"

The food \nservice facility at the  \nTwin Towers Correctional \nFacility feeds approximately  \n7,000 residents each day \nfor a total of 630,000 meals \neach month. \nMeals are primarily served on reusable plastic trays that are washed \nafter each use. Facilities that utilize disposable single use dishware \nand utensils generate substantially more trash than facilities using \nreusable dishware and utensils. Initial cost to purchase durable and \nreusable foodware, as well as labor costs associated with washing \ncan be recouped over time due to the reduced cost of disposal and \nproduct purchasing.\nDeliveries in Reusable Crates and  \nShipping Containers\nFacilities like Acton \nRehabilitation Center and \nTwin Towers Correctional \nFacility receive supplies that \nare delivered in reusable \ncrates. In some locations, \nemptied crates are reused \nfor the delivery of sack \nlunches to residents. \nUltimately, the crates are taken back by the vendor on a rotating \nbasis when new products are delivered. The use of reusable crates \ncan greatly reduce disposal. Additionally, vendors may be willing to \nnegotiate reduced purchasing costs if your facility agrees to make a \none-time investment in reusable crates.Rotation and Organization of Meal Supplies \nFood supply rotation is a preferred way to manage stock, as it \nreduces food spoilage. Central Juvenile Hall prepares meals for staff \nand residents at its facility. They have several practices in place to \nensure minimal food goes to waste. Viable leftover food is saved \nfor the next day\u2019s meal or \nserved to staff members \nfor dinner. To prevent \nover-preparation, supplies \nare ordered based on the \nnumber of meals served. \nThis facility has a consistent \nnumber of residents which \nallows the kitchen to know \nhow many meals to make; \nhowever, facilities with \nvarying populations may need to develop more comprehensive \nfood supply analytics to track appropriate purchases. Dry storage is \norganized by date and the oldest supplies are rotated forward and \nused first. Food expiration dates are noted on a board and checked \nregularly to ensure that \u201cclose to expiring\u201d items do not go to waste. \nMeals are prepared from \u201csoonest to expire\u201d foods.\nRepurposing Leftover Food and Scraps\nLos Verdes Golf Course \nin Rancho Palos Verdes \nhosts special events in their \nbanquet hall. To reduce \nwaste, event staff orders \nfood based on the number \nof expected guests. \nWhen there are excess \ningredients, such as meat, \nstaff will save the items and \nuse them in the next day\u2019s \nlunch at the on-site restaurant. They also make soups and stews \nfrom leftover vegetables and scraps. Los Verdes orders spices and \ncondiments in bulk containers. Food items are marked clearly with \nexpiration dates and \u201cbest-by\u201d dates for all kitchen staff members.\nSummer Lunch Food Donation\nPamela Park in LA County unincorporated community of Duarte  \nparticipates in the Parks and Recreation Department\u2019s Summer \nLunch Program, which \nprovides free meals to \nchildren attending day \ncamp. The park serves \napproximately  \n65 meals each day. \nThe number of meals \nneeded is predicted based \non past recipients and \ncamp attendees. If there \nare leftover meals, they are saved and handed out at the next day\u2019s \nlunch. After two days, remaining meals that are not expired and that \nhave been properly stored are given to families that attend the lunch \nprogram to take home.EPA Food Recovery Hierarchy"

In 2018, more than one million tons of textiles were disposed in California landfills. The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) defines \u201ctextiles\u201d to include cloth, rags, clothing, towels, sheets, rope, shoes, purses, and belts made from natural  and synthetic fibers. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation puts global textile industry emissions at 1.2 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per-year, which is nearly equivalent to emissions from 1.3 million cars driving on the road each year. The energy used to repair, wash, and reuse textiles is substantially less than manufacturing new items. Methods to reduce, reuse, and repair textiles will reduce the environmental impacts of textile manufacturing.\nThere are various methods to reduce, \nreuse, and repair textiles. A \nfacility may consider \ncontracting with a \nlaundry service provider \nto have linens or uniforms \npicked up, washed, and then returned. Some facilities may benefit from purchasing a washer and dryer. Other best management practices include purchasing recycled textiles \nsuch as carpet and rags, donating or repurposing garments and bedding, and using high-quality, non-toxic cleaners that extend the life of fabrics.Tips, Resources, and \nAssistance\nStart a Textile Recycling \nProgram for your facility: \ndpw.lacounty.gov/epd/ge/documents/ProjectResources/GE%20\nT extile%20Event%20\nGuide.pdf \n\u25cf Find a loc al textile \nrecycler using Los Angeles \nCounty\u2019s useful look-up \ntool: ladpw.org/epd/sbr/ \n\u25cf F or surplus donation\ncontact Countywide\nSurplus EquipmentProgram at: 323-267-2339\n\u25cf Find mor e uses for reusing\ntextiles: fire.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HHMD-Fact-Sheet-Used-T extile-\nManagement.pdf\nDonate used clothing, \nblankets, and other textiles at local non-profits and animal shelters. 1.2 million tons of textiles are \ndisposed in California per year including clothing, footwear, linens, towels, and other fabrics.The average person disposes  \nof 82 pounds per year of textiles and only 8.5% get reused  \nor recycled.Californians spend more than $70 million dollars annually disposing of used textiles.\nSource: 2018 Facility-Based \nCharacterization of Solid Waste in California dated May 15, 2020Source: Generation Earth Textile Recycling Guidedpw.lacounty.gov/epd/ge/documents/ProjectResources/GE%20Textile%20Event%20Guide.pdf Source: \nSMARTASN/assets/File/resources/\nSMART_PressKitOnline.pdf\ncalrecycle.ca.gov/reducewaste/\ntextiles\nsmartasn.org/Los Angeles County Facilities Case Studies\nRepair and Reuse T extiles \nLaundry repair and reuse services can \ngreatly reduce the amount of textiles \nsent  to landfills. At the Twin Towers \nCorrectional Facility, textiles are washed, \nrepaired, and then returned by the \ncontracted service. This maintains and \nextends the life of garments and bedding.\nThe facility places designated bins on \neach floor and in multiple locations for \nconvenient collection of dirty linens. \nOnce the bins are full, the contents are \ntransferred into cloth bags and staged \nfor collection by the contracted service. \nLinens that are too damaged for repair \nare removed and donated to a textile \nrecycler to be made into rags and other \nproducts such as fiber-fill.There are many \nlocal organizations that may accept used \ntextiles, such as housing shelters and \nanimal rescue facilities. Reuse Event Linens\nReusable tablecloths, napkins, and \ntable skirts can enhance decor and \nhelp ensure that single use foodservice \nware products do not end up in the \nlandfill. The Los Verdes Golf Course in \nPalos Verdes has a sit-down restaurant \nand hosts special events, which use \nwashable linens. Initially, the cost of \npurchasing washable linens was more \nexpensive than disposables.However, \nwhen comparing the ongoing costs of  \npurchasing and disposing disposables, \nthe reusable linen option quickly made \nsense.   \nLinen rental services are an option for \nevent venues. Keep in mind that there \nwill be an initial purchase investment; \nhowever, over time the cost should be \nrecouped through reductions associated \nwith repeated use. Reuse Rags and T owels \nLos Angeles County Fire Stations wash \nand dry fire trucks using reusable cloth \nrags. This is an excellent example of cost \nsavings and waste reduction for facilities \nthat maintain vehicles. The volume of \ntowels used is minimal, so each station is \nable to manage the washing and drying \non-site.\nCollection bins are set-up in a \nconvenient location and labeled for \n\u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d rags. Services are also \navailable that swap-out dirty rags with \nclean ones. This is a good option if there \nis no washer and dryer on-site or if there \nare concerns that dirt and oils will stain \nwork uniforms or other items that need \nservice. Rags can be purchased through \na service, or acquired by contacting local \nthrift shops to pick up donated clothing \nthat is not saleable.\nWash and Reuse Hospital Linens\nMultiple Los Angeles County facilities reuse bedding, uniforms and personal linens. \nThese include hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, social services and fire stations. One \nexample is the Pomona Health Center, where soiled lab and technician coats are \ncollected and laundered, then returned for reuse.\nThe Los Angeles County +  USC Medical Center has switched to using  textiles that \ncan be washed and reused, including bed liners, patient gowns, laboratory coats, \nand other hospital uniforms. At this facility, items are collected in rolling carts labeled \nspecifically for textiles. A laundering service picks up the carts at the same time as \ndropping off clean textiles. This method reduces excess transportation and ensures \nthe hospital maintains sufficient supply of all items. "
